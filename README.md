# hello-world
hello-world, my name is Alexander. I guess I'm here to build something
Greetings all, my name is Alexander. Cryptocurrencies have captured my attention since the ATH in 2017 and as I traversed the cryptosphere I eventually found Ivan on Tech. After a little over a year of following the trends to mid 2019, I realized it was time to participate in the game. Iâ€™ve joined the academy in Sept '19 and, quite honestly, did not follow through past the 7 day trial. I let go of the motivation and life started to rutt into working the night shift and letting the days pass on. Now, once again I find myself with the motivation to pursue blockchain development to make a future of my own. 

I discovered for myself in university how governments and institutions function and I realized the criminal nature of the global financial system as it exists today. Blockchain is a challenge to the status quo and the most significant threat to true evil and corruption. 
 
Greetings and good luck to everyone in their own personal development :+1:
