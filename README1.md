# hello-world

 My name is Alex. While pursuing a 4yr degree in Intelligence Analytics and Security, I realized that employment in one of the US alphabet soup agencies was not fit for me or my soul. I realized the game theory being played in our civilization/currency and chose a different path than I originally anticipated. I currently work for a Resort as a Loss Prevention Officer. While doing this, I have developed hobbies in observing the state of the universe and blockchain technologies.
 I do not know where these hobbies will lead me, but I go EONF.
